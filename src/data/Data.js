      When I was in my sophomore year, I had to take Java and C++ fundamentals
      in my CS-minor Class. That was the first time I got to know the art of
      programming.Even though it was so basic, I had a clear realization of
      basic data structures and some algorithms. CS being a minor subject, the
      journey didn't go too far. Since last year , I dived into
      web-development.It was slow but effective. From basic HTML,Css
      fundamentals , I kept learning till I got some real-life projects.
