        <p>
          When I was in my sophomore year, I had to take Java and C++
          fundamentals in my CS-minor Class. That was the first time I got to
          know the art of programming.Even though it was so basic, I had a clear
          realization of basic data structures and some algorithms. CS being a
          minor subject, the journey didn't go too far.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since last year , I dived into web-development.It was slow but
          effective. From basic HTML,Css fundamentals , I kept learning till I
          got some real-life projects.
